Red flag warnings are in place through Tuesday night. Aircraft will continue to provide support as conditions allow. Firefighters continue to patrol fire lines, reinforce primary control lines, and establish secondary and contingency lines. Fire continues to burn in steep and rugged terrain.</p>\r\n<p>Residents are encouraged to stay vigilant and to monitor evacuation information and road closures, including social media and local, law enforcement websites, for the most current information. Residents will see smoke coming from trees and stumps for days following their return. Proceed with caution because burned out areas may have unseen hazards. Residents are encouraged to call 911 if they are concerned about any active flames near their homes or businesses.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Dixie Fire East Zone: </strong>Low relative humidity and Red Flag warnings are expected to continue through Tuesday evening. Strong southwest winds created extreme fire behavior, resulting in large columns of smoke that continued to challenge firefighters on Grizzly Ridge. Fire Crews shored up the dozer lines, along Grizzly ridge as they add depth and continue to firmly hold the line. Dozer lines are are being extended east of Grizzly ridge to tie the fire back in to the Walker scar. Mop up continues in Genesee Valley and into Taylorsville with tactical patrols on active look out for any hot spots and responding to any smoke reports. New contingency lines are being added between the fire, Greenhorn, Portola, and the communities further south all the way around North Lake Davis to protect the homes, should the need arise.</p>\r\n<p>For more information on the Dixie Fire visit the following links:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>CAL FIRE <a href=\"https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents\"> https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents</a></li>\r\n<li>USFS Information <a href=\"https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/7690/\">https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/7690/</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>**Refer to the Evacuation Map for up-to-date notices.

The goal is to safely repopulate these communities in collaboration with our stakeholders as soon as possible. <br /><br />Contingency line construction near Helena, with resources from both zones is ongoing and will assist in the protection of Junction City and Weaverville from future fire threats. Reinforcement of established fire line, mop-up and patrol continue from the North/South zone boundary to Cedar Gulch. Several small spot fires west of Cedar Gulch and north of Hyampom Road were observed and extinguished; crews will continually monitor this area and secure the fire line overnight.</p>\r\n<p>Northern California has experienced large fire activity and will likely experience an extended fire season. Fires burning in northern California are exhibiting extreme fire growth based on critical fuel conditions. The prioritization of resources is always based on life, property, and natural resources. Under these drought conditions, wildfires are burning rapidly with extreme severity and have traveled up to 8 miles in a single day. Fire spread is fuel driven and does not depend on wind speed, as we have seen in previous years. Firefighters are experiencing conditions never seen before, such as increased rates of spread, spotting and active nighttime burning. We coordinate very closely with the US Forest Service and CalOES for our local and out of state partners, to ensure resources are shared. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Community Meetings:</strong> A virtual community meeting will be held at 6:00 P.M. Wednesday, September 1st. The meeting will be live streamed on the CAL FIRE Shasta-Trinity Unit Facebook page, CAL FIRE IMT 5’s YouTube channel and Shasta Trinity National Forest Facebook page.

Red flag warnings are in place through Tuesday night. Aircraft will continue to provide support as conditions allow. Firefighters continue to patrol fire lines, reinforce primary control lines, and establish secondary and contingency lines. Fire continues to burn in steep and rugged terrain.</p>\r\n<p>Residents are encouraged to stay vigilant and to monitor evacuation information and road closures, including social media and local, law enforcement websites, for the most current information. Residents will see smoke coming from trees and stumps for days following their return. Proceed with caution because burned out areas may have unseen hazards. Residents are encouraged to call 911 if they are concerned about any active flames near their homes or businesses.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Dixie Fire East Zone: </strong>Low relative humidity and Red Flag warnings are expected to continue through Tuesday evening. Strong southwest winds created extreme fire behavior, resulting in large columns of smoke that continued to challenge firefighters on Grizzly Ridge. Fire Crews shored up the dozer lines, along Grizzly ridge as they add depth and continue to firmly hold the line. Dozer lines are are being extended east of Grizzly ridge to tie the fire back in to the Walker scar. Mop up continues in Genesee Valley and into Taylorsville with tactical patrols on active look out for any hot spots and responding to any smoke reports. New contingency lines are being added between the fire, Greenhorn, Portola, and the communities further south all the way around North Lake Davis to protect the homes, should the need arise.</p>\r\n<p>For more information on the Dixie Fire visit the following links:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>CAL FIRE <a href=\"https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents\"> https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents</a></li>\r\n<li>USFS Information <a href=\"https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/7690/\">https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/7690/</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>**Refer to the Evacuation Map for up-to-date notices.

The goal is to safely repopulate these communities in collaboration with our stakeholders as soon as possible. <br /><br />Contingency line construction near Helena, with resources from both zones is ongoing and will assist in the protection of Junction City and Weaverville from future fire threats. Reinforcement of established fire line, mop-up and patrol continue from the North/South zone boundary to Cedar Gulch. Several small spot fires west of Cedar Gulch and north of Hyampom Road were observed and extinguished; crews will continually monitor this area and secure the fire line overnight.</p>\r\n<p>Northern California has experienced large fire activity and will likely experience an extended fire season. Fires burning in northern California are exhibiting extreme fire growth based on critical fuel conditions. The prioritization of resources is always based on life, property, and natural resources. Under these drought conditions, wildfires are burning rapidly with extreme severity and have traveled up to 8 miles in a single day. Fire spread is fuel driven and does not depend on wind speed, as we have seen in previous years. Firefighters are experiencing conditions never seen before, such as increased rates of spread, spotting and active nighttime burning. We coordinate very closely with the US Forest Service and CalOES for our local and out of state partners, to ensure resources are shared. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Community Meetings:</strong> A virtual community meeting will be held at 6:00 P.M. Wednesday, September 1st. The meeting will be live streamed on the CAL FIRE Shasta-Trinity Unit Facebook page, CAL FIRE IMT 5’s YouTube channel and Shasta Trinity National Forest Facebook page.
